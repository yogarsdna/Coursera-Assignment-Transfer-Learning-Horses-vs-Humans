# Coursera Assignment - Transfer Learning Horses vs Humans

This is one of the Coursera assignments provided in the Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow course in the week 3 section where it discusses Transfer Learning. This assignment is about applying Transfer Learning to utilize an already-trained network to help us solve a similar problem to the one it was originally trained to solve such as increasing training accuracy for the Horses v Humans dataset.
